**User Authentication System**

The user authentication system is designed to provide secure login and registration functionality for web applications. 

Users can sign up for an account by providing necessary details like email, username, and password, which are securely stored after password hashing to protect sensitive information. 

Once registered, users can log in using their credentials, where their identity is verified through a secure process, ensuring data protection.

Additionally, the system employs session management or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for persistent logins, ensuring that users remain authenticated across sessions without compromising security.

This setup guarantees both the safety and seamless experience for users throughout the platform.
